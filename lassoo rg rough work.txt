LASSoo
shrinkage and variable selection
places constraint on coefficients
shrinkage some shrink towards zero
subset of predictors
can provide greater prediction error
Increase model interpretability
greater prediction accuracy
tunig parameter  lambda
when lambda is 0

--need to standardzie
--then import preprocessing
Least angle rgession
LAR adds a predictor first add most correlated with the response move towards least square next add predictor most correlated with resids repeats until tested all predictors
